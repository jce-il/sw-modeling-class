Project name: [AndEngine](http://www.andengine.org/)

AndEngine is a popular and "easy" to use game framework for Android.

AndEngine is currently available in two versions: GLES1 and GLES2. 
The GLES1 version supports OpenGL ES 1.x. (99% of Android devices can run a game built using this version)
And GLES2 supports OpenGL ES 2.0. This branch is actively being worked on, and nearly 93% of current Android devices can run a game that’s been made with this branch.

AndEngine Pros:
It has a complete 2-D scene graph, with a "easy-to-use" API.
It works really well with the Android activity lifecycle.
It has a number of extensions that can be added as plugins.
It’s free
It's open

AndEngine Cons:
The biggest problem I’ve faced while using AndEngine is that the API is undocumented. 
This can increase the development time, as you sometimes need to go through the engine source code to figure things out. 
The reason why there is not documentation is that the developers doesn't believe that their code need documentation.
We (Natan and Oshri) tried to understand and use the code, it is really very readable code but still some documentation would
make it easier.
The bright side of the story is that there are a lot of online tutorial and a book that helps to undersend the code, 
and the most helpful are the examples project.

***Given documentation and/or source code:***
There are two main branches to this project, the original project created by 
Nicolas and a new branch with bugfixes and new libraries created by Mayo: 
[Nicloas branch](https://github.com/nicolasgramlich?tab=repositories)
[Mayo branch](https://github.com/realmayo)
