Work in this course is done in pairs and submitted through github.

If you prefer that your solution will not be publicly visible [request private repositories][private-repos].


##Submissions Instructions
1. To start, [**fork** the course repository][forking] (or [pull][ref-pull] for later updates).
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify/add files (in the hw directory) and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.

- **Submission dates**: Part 1. 26/3 17:15, Part 2+3. a week after, part 4: next lecture 

## Final Project (Preliminary)
### Stage 1
- Select a known open source project (git is already captured for class demo)
  - Here are some sources for ideas: [leading github projects](https://github.com/showcases), Book: [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html), [Hasadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/projects/) (The Public Knowledge Workshop),...
  - Cloud related ideas and papers from the original course: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs525/sp2015/sched.htm

- Open a repo for this project and link from course wiki (by PR the README)

### Stage 2
- Describe the main requirements/features of the product
- Describe the given documentation
- Describe major or important designs with UML diagrams and or other modeling means
- Describe a few challenges for this project (e.g., a missing feature, known bugs)
- Register to talk about it at class

### Stage 3
- Select Part A of other group
- Review their work
Work on an improvement to this class according to the given documents (suggest other models)
