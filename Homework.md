  - Cloud related ideas and papers from the source course we use: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs525/sp2015/sched.htm 
- Review resources (repos, papers, posts)
- Open a repo for your project and link from the [project](Projects.md) list on the course wiki (by PR of course)
- (the lecturer will discuss the suggestion with you)

**Submission date**: 14/5
