## Final Project

Grades are according to how much your work is: deep, relevant (to the course), presented well (written and oral), on time

### Stage 1
- Select a known open source project (git is already captured for class demo)
  - Here are some sources for ideas: [leading github projects](https://github.com/showcases), Book: [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html), [Hasadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/projects/) (The Public Knowledge Workshop),...
  - Cloud related ideas and papers from the source course we use: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs525/sp2015/sched.htm 
- Review resources (repos, papers, posts)
- Open a repo for your project and link from the [project](Projects.md) list on the course wiki (by PR of course)
- (the lecturer will discuss the suggestion with you)

**Submission date**: 14/5

### Stage 2
- Describe the main requirements/features of the product
- Describe the given documentation and/or source code
- Describe the major or important designs with UML diagrams and or other modeling means
- Describe a few challenges for this project (e.g., a missing feature, known bugs)
- Register to talk about it at class (again by setting a date on the project list)

You can submit this stage as a presentation or draft paper

**Submission date**: 28/5

### Stage 3
- Add your presentation to the projects page
